What is a data warehouse?
A Data Warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile collection of data, designed to support management decision-making processes. 

Subject-Oriented: A data warehouse organizes data around specific subjects, such as sales or customer interactions, making it easier to analyze.
Integrated: It consolidates data from different sources, ensuring consistency by resolving any conflicts in data formats or definitions.
Time-Variant: Unlike operational systems, a data warehouse stores historical data over extended periods, allowing trend analysis and time-based insights.
Non-Volatile: Once data is stored in the warehouse, it remains stable; it cannot be deleted or altered, ensuring historical accuracy and reliability.
